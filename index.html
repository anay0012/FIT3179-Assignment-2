  <p style="text-align: center;">Coral reefs around the world are experiencing severe damage due to widespread bleaching
    events. Once vibrant ecosystems filled with colourful corals and diverse marine life, many reefs are now turning
    white and losing their ability to support marine biodiversity. According to scientists, more than half of the
    world’s coral reefs have already been lost or severely degraded, with the Great Barrier Reef, one of the most iconic
    natural wonders, suffering multiple mass bleaching events in recent years. These damages not only threaten marine
    species that depend on coral habitats but also endanger coastal communities that rely on reefs for food, tourism,
    and protection from storms.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center" ;> One of the main causes of coral bleaching is the rise in ocean temperatures. Corals
    have a symbiotic relationship with tiny algae called zooxanthellae, which live inside their tissues and provide them
    with both food and colour. When ocean temperatures rise even slightly—often just 1–2°C above normal—the corals
    become stressed and expel these algae. Without the algae, the corals lose their colour and, more importantly, their
    main source of energy. If the high temperatures persist, the corals are unable to recover and eventually die,
    leading to the collapse of entire reef ecosystems.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center" ;>This rise in ocean temperature is closely linked to increasing levels of carbon
    dioxide (CO₂) in the atmosphere. Human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial
    processes release massive amounts of CO₂, which trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere and cause global warming. As the
    planet warms, so do the oceans, since they absorb about 90% of the excess heat generated by greenhouse gases. This
    warming leads to more frequent and severe coral bleaching events worldwide. Therefore, reducing CO₂ emissions is
    crucial not only for mitigating climate change but also for protecting coral reefs—the “rainforests of the sea”—from
    disappearing entirely.</p>
